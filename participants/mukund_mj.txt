I am from BITS PILANI. 
I wish to chase life wherever it takes me.
Maybe, someday I will find an abyss, delving into which would lead me to freedom.
Maybe that is why I joined on Independence day, 4th of july, coincidences they say, I say nah, it's all aconspiracy.
You should watch NHK! to know where I am coming from.
In college I have watched deep stuff, made deep relations and found deep waters to swim in.
Nah, silly, I have watched anime, movies, youtube a ton, enough to chit-chat if ur interested(I am not tho, I like references tho).
I ran long distance in college, like reading stuff, listened to a lot of music, am into real-life stuff; yep interested to talk on that.
Don't judge me if you accidentally read this. I have written all this assuming that the probability of anybody reading this is 2/51.
if ur reading this, ur just unlucky and surely, i am beyond reason.
